# Lunar Lander

Lunar Lander is a physics-based game where the player controls a lunar module's descent, adjusting thrust and angle to land safely on the moon's surface. The player must carefully balance speed and fuel to avoid crashing. This was developed using C#/.NET and MonoGame.

The game's terrain in procedurally generated, so every game is a different experience. Lunar Lander starts with two guaranteed safe zones. After completing one level, there will only be one slightly smaller safe zone. Your high scores are saved, so try to get to the highest level possible!

You can also adjust the game's controls to any keybinding you wish.
